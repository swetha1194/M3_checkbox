## Overview

We're studying what web resources developers use while programming. Specifically, we're studying the urls that developers reference while programming. The study **requires no work other than uploading existing data** relevant to the study. To be eligible for this study, you must be a developer with at least `1 month of programming history` related to web development. 

## Instructions

This study should take less than 10 minutes. There are three options to upload your history:

#### 1) Chrome Extension

This option is simple and transparent, and you get to keep using a useful tool. `docsight` uses a [whitelist](https://github.com/chrisparnin/docsight/blob/master/js/filterpresets.js) approach for filtering visits to developer sites.  To filter google searches, only searches within the past 30 seconds of a developer site are included. You can add your own custom filtering:

    @include https://github.com/*/issues* 
    @exclude https://github.com/*/issues/new* 
    @exclude *://stackoverflow.com/users*

You can also check out the source code on [github](https://github.com/chrisparnin/docsight).

**Download** `docsight`: [chrome.google.com/webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/docsight/ceacnbgdhcnofnomlkmackaennjfmnpc?hl=en)

#### 2) SQLite Database

If you don't use Chrome or don't want to use a Chrome extension, you could also upload the history database itself.  The history database is a sqlite file, called `History` in Chrome or `places.sqlite` in Firefox.
Some locations of the history database are below:

Windows firefox users:

```none
	C:\Users\[user]\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\[profile]\places.sqlite
```

Mac Chrome users:

```none
	~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History
```

Windows Chrome Users:

```none
	* On XP â€“ C:\Documents and Settings\\Local Settings\Application Data\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\History
	* On Vista - C:\Users\\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\History
```

#### 3) SQLite Export

Finally, if you wish to instead export your data, you can use a sqlite viewer such as firefox's sqlite plugin and use a query like this to export you data.

	SELECT datetime(moz_historyvisits.visit_date/1000000,'unixepoch'), moz_places.url
	FROM moz_places, moz_historyvisits 
	WHERE moz_places.id = moz_historyvisits.place_id
			
Chrome version

	SELECT visits.visit_time, urls.url
	FROM visits, urls 
	WHERE visits.url = urls.id
